    <p id="rules" style="display:none">Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic, has a keen obsession of keeping everything in order. An obsession that has led this skilled Ministry witch to employ creative methods to spy in her private office. The discrete decorative china painted with cats does a better job of spying than simple Thief's curse that can be broken by a powerful witch or a wizard.<br><br>
      But beware! There is danger lurking around… she has known enemies of near-human intelligence that won’t be stopped by simple spells or spying tactics. A hoard of angry centaurs will stomp in her office and wreck havoc before anyone can say "Veritaserum". <br><br>
      Your task is simple. Collect as much spying china as possible to keep those nasty and icky students out, while saving her from the angry centaurs. Collecting china will give her a boost in her life, but if she is hit by a centaur, her life will decrease it by 10.
