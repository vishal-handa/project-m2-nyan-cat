# Centaur and the Squeak
<img src="screenshots/intro-screen.png">

The name of the game is derived from a chapter from Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix **Centaur and the Sneak**. The game has multiple "objects" falling from the top, and the player (Dolores Umbridge) has to either catch them, or get away from them. The objects to catch are circular china with cat prints that give her life, and the objects to avoid are the centaurs that take away life. As soon as the lives reaches 0, that means the player has failed and the game is finished.


Following is the picture of the game play.
